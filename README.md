# California_HOUSE_PRICE_PREDICTOR

# Housing Price Prediction

## Overview
This project is a machine learning-based solution designed to predict housing prices based on a variety of factors such as location, square footage, number of rooms, and other key features. The goal is to develop an accurate and efficient predictive model using data-driven techniques. This project is implemented in a Google Colab and leverages various Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing data distribution, correlations, and trends through visualizations.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selecting the most important features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training multiple machine learning models and evaluating their performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Predictions and Performance Metrics**: Making housing price predictions and assessing accuracy using metrics like RMSE, MSE.

## Technologies Used
This project utilizes the following technologies:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Environment**: Google Colab
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
  - **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
  - **Model Deployment (Future Scope)**: Flask or FastAPI

## Installation Guide
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.8 or higher). You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Steps to Set Up
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/housing-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```sh
   cd housing-price-prediction
   ```
3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
### Running the Google Colab
1. Open the Google Colab  interface:
   ```sh
   Google Colab
   ```
2. Locate and open `Housing_Price_Prediction.ipynb`.
3. Execute each cell step-by-step to perform data analysis, train models, and generate predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset should be placed in the `data/` directory. If the dataset is publicly available, provide a link for users to download it. Example:
- **Source**: [Kaggle - House Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- **Data Format**: CSV file with columns such as `Price`, `Location`, `Bedrooms`, `Bathrooms`, `Square Footage`, etc.

## Results
After training the machine learning models, the project will output:
- **Model Performance Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, R-squared values.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identifying which features have the most impact on housing prices.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Price distributions
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Scatter plots of key features
  - Residual analysis of model predictions

## Future Improvements
- **Enhancing Model Accuracy**: Experimenting with ensemble models like Random Forest, XGBoost, and deep learning.
- **Deployment**: Building a web application using Flask or FastAPI to allow users to input features and receive price predictions.
- **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using GridSearchCV or Optuna to optimize model parameters.
- **Integration with Real-Time Data**: Incorporating live data from real estate APIs.
